"""Pre-registered bio-vs-vanilla ablation matrix (bead hwxb.5.1).

This is the **machine-readable specification** of the headline experiment: *does the biology help,
and which mechanism?* It is the single source of truth that the ablation runner (hwxb.5.2) and the
dry-run validator (hwxb.7.4) consume; the human-readable rationale lives in
``docs/ablation_matrix.md`` and the metric definitions in ``docs/eval_benchmark_matrix.md``.

Design (honoring the bead's pinned review comments):

1. **Three anchors, to disentangle ARCHITECTURE from MECHANISMS.** ``GPTSynaptic`` with every bio
   flag off is still a *different architecture* than vanilla ``GPT`` (presyn attention augmentation,
   router probe, Xi, MoE). So a bare ``vanilla`` vs ``bio_all`` contrast confounds the two. We add a
   ``synaptic_off`` anchor (the synaptic architecture, all mechanisms off — byte-identical-default
   per the unit tests) so the experiment decomposes cleanly:
     - ``synaptic_off − vanilla``      = effect of the synaptic ARCHITECTURE alone,
     - ``mechanism − synaptic_off``    = the CLEAN isolated effect of a mechanism (same arch, one flag),
     - ``bio_all − vanilla``           = the TOTAL bio effect.
   ``vanilla`` is **param-matched** to ``GPTSynaptic`` by adjusting depth/width (the synaptic stack
   adds parameters); the runner records both param counts.

2. **Both ablation directions.** LEAVE-ONE-OUT (``bio_all`` minus each default-on mechanism) measures
   a mechanism's marginal contribution *given the others*; ADD-ONE-IN (``synaptic_off`` plus each
   opt-in mechanism, with its prerequisites) measures a mechanism's standalone effect on the clean
   architecture anchor. Both are derived directly from the ablation registry, so this matrix cannot
   drift from the code's notion of what is ablatable.

3. **Staged compute, with a go/no-go gate.** A cheap SCREENING pass (small budget, few seeds) drops
   clearly-non-helping mechanisms; an expensive CONFIRMATION pass (full budget, >=3 seeds) runs only
   on the survivors plus the anchors. Commit the GPU-hour estimate and pass the gate before the
   confirmation pass — never burn days of 4090 time blindly.

The mechanism set is the authoritative ``ablation_registry.MECHANISMS`` list. ``flex_attention`` and
``native_genetics`` are EXCLUDED from the science matrix: they are performance/kernel toggles, not
biological mechanisms (flex is prefill-only and incompatible with KV-cache decode eval; native needs
CUDA). Global neuromodulation (hy8.1) and NeuroScore are NOT yet registered ablation mechanisms, so
they are not in this matrix; registering them is a documented prerequisite for including them
(see ``docs/ablation_matrix.md`` §"Known gaps").
