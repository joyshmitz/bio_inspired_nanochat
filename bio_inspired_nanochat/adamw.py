Not a general optimizer! But works for our specific use.

DDP design (hwxb.2.1)
---------------------
``DistAdamW`` is a ZeRO-2-style optimizer: gradients are averaged across ranks and
optimizer state is sharded, so each rank only stores/updates its slice of every
parameter before the updated parameter is re-replicated with an all-gather.

Sharding is along dim 0, which requires ``param.shape[0] % world_size == 0``. The
bio-inspired model has many *small* learnable Parameters that violate this — most
importantly **0-D scalar kinetics** (``learnable_kinetics=True`` adds per-layer
``theta_*`` scalars) and odd-length 1-D vectors. Sharding those is impossible
(a 0-D tensor has no ``shape[0]``; an odd 1-D vector is not divisible by 2). Such
params take a **replicated** path: their gradient is all-reduced (AVG) and every
rank applies the *full* AdamW update locally, so all ranks stay bit-identical
without any scatter/gather. The per-element math is identical on both paths
(``_adamw_update_`` is the single source of truth), so the sharded and replicated
paths produce the same parameter values — verified by ``tests/test_scaleup_ddp.py``.
