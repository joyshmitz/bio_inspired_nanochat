### Excerpt

> **§99**: "I then started to do some preliminary experiments here, and I did an experiment which was never published but in fact is quite an interesting experiment, because it proved that no new ribosomes could be made and this experiment which... which involves the following. If you take bacteria and starve them of magnesium, then after a long period of time – they remain viable – they lose their ribosomes and they destroy them and they turn them over, and that means that when you start 'em up again, by giving them a good medium, they have to take a long time to make new ribosomes to get going. So what I said, 'Well, I'll do a quickie'. That's an... that's an experiment which you'll see if you're on the right grounds because if it is true that new ribosomes are made after phage infection, my destroying the old ones wouldn't..."

> **§100**: "Some of the things I tried then were... were quite interesting, you see. For example, because the caesium chloride we were using to centrifuge these ribosomes was, what we say, 8 molal. That's almost like molar but not quite but you can imagine that it's 8 moles of the salt – that's very, very strong salt – and salt has to be soluble, and of course I discovered that there're bacteria that they'd got out of the Dead Sea that liked to live in 4 molar salt. So we think, why don't we try these, you know, because these will be ribosomes that like a lot of salt, so I actually got them you know, but of course we couldn't have done the experiment because they weren't sensitive to our bacteriophage, and in the end one had to do it with this. And the dramatic thing which is recounted is..."

> **§103**: "Well, we gathered from communication with Matt Meselson that it was a matter of weeks that they would produce their results. We knew they didn't... they hadn't done the sort of experiments that we had done, because what we had decided to go for was a really definitive one which would demonstrate that new RNA was added to old ribosomes. And their experiments involved in showing there was an RNA fraction that was on ribosomes. They did this by a sucrose gradient technique. As it happened our paper sat around for a few months, because I think... and... but it doesn't matter. As far as we're concerned, it was I think the experiment had its own intrinsic value, and in fact what to me, you know, was not reproduced by the Watson was in fact the... the logical depth of our argument. And now that seems ridiculous that we would..."

> **§105**: "I certainly know at... for my own, since I believe I was... I was the first to have the curtain drawn, at least that's how it seemed to me. That for me, I... suddenly the curtain got opened and I could see it all. And certainly I don't think I would have been led to think about that funny connection; you see, the thing is this: you talk about phage T4, you get all involved in the intricacies of this, and if you talk about two things simultaneously, so, you know, you have a lot of green balls bouncing and you have a lot of red balls bouncing, then sometimes you can just see one set of balls bouncing the same way. And I think that is so necessary to continue, you know, almost hysterical conversation, just constitutive talking, because I think that brings things together that you don't actually..."

> **§106**: "Of course, at the same time we were doing all of this genetic work and round about then we... Francis had started to play around in the lab with mutants. And his idea was he would look at internal suppressors of these mutants. Now, for example, one thing he proposed to test by this method was the following: that the message was read off the DNA as follows, it went up one chain and then came down the other chain, you see. That would mean, if you got a mutation, it would affect a protein here – OK – but you could compensate for it by mutation in a completely different place. So he was trying to ask whether there was some kind of interaction. And his first mutants didn't give him much joy; he started with a few of the base analogue ones. By the way, Dick Feynman started..."

> **§160**: "One of the things I did was, to teach myself computing thoroughly, I decided to implement a language. And this language I found in a publication, it's called TRAC — T-R-A-C — It's Text Reckoner And Compiler, published in the Journal of the American Association of Computing Machinery, 1965, by a man called Calvin Mooers, who I ascertained two years ago was still alive. And I was very impressed by this because I actually did write an interpreter for it, and... and became so fascinated by this language that even on my present machines the first thing I've done is write an interpreter for Trac, and my versions of Trac include a whole lot of new constructs, and these have never been published. So I think the idea that one has a private computer language seems to me to be rather sophisticated and perhaps we can all emulate that in..."

> **§208**: "I think organisms have to be computed from their DNA sequences, just as we have to compute proteins from its DNA... a protein from its DNA sequence. Now, when I say compute, I... I mean it in the sense of... of a computation, this need not be a calculation but in fact... and we may not even use a... a digital computer, almost certainly we will, because it's a universal computer, when programmed with the right program we could do this. Now, we have to do it in this way for the simple reason that this is the only way you can get to the final... the so-called final explanation. Otherwise we simply have a set of anecdotes, and this is particularly true if we want to go to yet a more complex thing, which is how to account for behaviour, for the operations of the nervous system. If we..."
