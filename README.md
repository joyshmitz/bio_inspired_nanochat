This is a research fork of [Nanochat](https://github.com/karpathy/nanochat) that replaces standard static weights with **computational analogs of synaptic proteins**, implementing biologically-grounded mechanisms for working memory, attention modulation, and neural architecture search.

Standard LLMs are "frozen crystals"—static matrices of `float16` numbers that never change once training is done. **Bio-Inspired Nanochat** is a "living fluid". Its connections grow, shrink, fatigue, recover, and even reproduce *during inference*, mimicking the energy-constrained efficiency of the biological brain.

## 🧠 The "Wetware" Stack: From Biology to Math

We map specific cellular mechanisms from the [Synaptic Cleft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_synapse) directly to tensor operations. This architecture is grounded in neuroscience literature and the blueprints found in `prompts/`.

### 1. Presynaptic Biophysics (The Sender)
*The mechanism of "Fatigue" and "Boredom"*

**The Biology**: Neurons run on batteries (ATP). If a neuron shouts too much (fires continuously), it runs out of neurotransmitter vesicles (chemical ammo). It *must* rest to reload.

**The Math**: We track a fluid reservoir `RRP` (Readily Releasable Pool) for every attention head. High attention scores drain the pool.

**The Effect**: A physically-grounded **frequency penalty**. The model literally *cannot* attend to the same token endlessly. It gets "bored" (depleted) and naturally shifts focus to novel information.

**Implementation**: Three backends for production use:
- **Triton GPU Kernel** (`bio_inspired_nanochat/triton_kernels/presyn_fused.py`): 375-line fused kernel, 3 passes over attention
- **Rust CPU Kernel** (`rust_src/src/presyn.rs`): PyO3-native implementation for CPU inference
- **Python Reference** (`tests/test_rust_kernels.py`): 130-line pure Python for validation

    E -->|Attenuates| A
    E -->|Consumes| D
    style D fill:#ff9999,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
```

### 2. Postsynaptic Density (The Receiver)
*The mechanism of "Working Memory"*

**The Biology**: "Neurons that fire together, wire together." A transient thought becomes a memory only if it is important (high activity) and the brain has energy to "write" it down (Consolidation).

**The Math**: Weights are split into $W_{slow}$ (Long-term) and $W_{fast}$ (Short-term).
$$ y = x(W_{slow} + \underbrace{W_{fast} + \text{Hebb}(x, y)}_{\text{The Scratchpad}}) $$

**The Effect**: **Infinite local context**. The model can define a variable at the start of a sentence and "remember" it at the end via the fast weights, without needing to attend back to it.

**New Mechanisms** (in progress):
- **BDNF Metaplasticity**: Activity-dependent learning rate modulation (90% implemented!)
- **CaMKII/PP1 Bistable Latch**: Hysteretic consolidation gate with self-excitation
- **Dual-Weight Differentiation**: Separate timescales for fast cache vs slow storage

### 3. Structural Plasticity (The Life Cycle)
*The mechanism of "Economy & Efficiency"*

**The Biology**: The brain is a ruthlessly efficient economy. It doesn't keep billions of idle neurons on payroll. Useful regions get more resources (Neurogenesis); idle regions are demolished (Pruning).

**The Math**: A **Synaptic Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)** where experts have a "Bank Account" (Energy).
*   **Taxation**: Every forward pass costs Energy.
*   **Income**: Being routed to earns Energy.
*   **Bankruptcy**: Experts with $E \approx 0$ are killed (Merged).
*   **IPO**: Wealthy, overworked experts clone themselves (Split).

**The Effect**: **Neural Architecture Search**. The model starts small and *grows* capacity exactly where the data complexity demands it.

## 🔬 Deep Dive: The Math of the Synapse

For the researchers, here are the governing equations implemented in `synaptic.py` and `neuroscore.py`.

### 1. Calcium Dynamics (The Integrator)
Calcium $C$ acts as a leaky integrator of the incoming attention signal (Logits $L$). It represents the "excitement" of the synapse.

$$ C_{t} = \alpha_{ca} \cdot \text{softplus}(L_t) + (1 - 1/\tau_c) \cdot C_{t-1} $$

### 2. The Release Probability (The Gate)
The probability $P_{release}$ that a vesicle is actually released depends on the Calcium level (detected by Synaptotagmin) versus the clamp (Complexin).

$$ P_{release} = \sigma(3 \cdot \text{Syt}(C) + 2 \cdot P_{primed} - 2 \cdot \text{Complexin}) \cdot \sigma(\text{Logits}) $$

Where $\text{Syt}(C)$ is a Hill equation modeling the calcium sensor's sensitivity:
$$ \text{Syt}(C) = \frac{C}{C + K_d} $$

### 3. Vesicle Depletion (The Limiter)
The actual synaptic weight $W_{eff}$ is limited by the available vesicles in the Readily Releasable Pool ($RRP$).

$$ W_{eff} = \min(P_{release}, RRP_t) $$
$$ RRP_{t+1} = RRP_t - W_{eff} + \text{RefillRate} $$

This non-linear clamping is what physically enforces the frequency penalty.

### 4. Hebbian Learning (The Fast Weight)
The postsynaptic weight update follows a gated Hebbian rule. We maintain low-rank eligibility traces $U, V$.

$$ \Delta W_{fast} = \eta \cdot (U \cdot V^T) \cdot \underbrace{\sigma(\text{CaMKII} - \text{PP1})}_{\text{Consolidation Gate}} $$

The gate opens only when CaMKII (Write signal) > PP1 (Erase signal).

### 5. NeuroScore Dynamics (The Credit Assignment)
In `neuroscore.py`, we calculate the evolutionary fitness of each expert using three metrics:

*   **Efficiency**: Performance per unit of metabolic cost.
    $$ \text{Eff}_i = \frac{\text{Contribution}_i}{\text{Energy}_i + \epsilon} $$
*   **Specialization**: How unique is the expert's input distribution compared to the global average?
    $$ \text{Spec}_i = 1 - \cos(\mu_{expert}, \mu_{global}) $$
*   **Resilience**: Stability of the expert's contribution over time (inverse variance).
    $$ \text{Res}_i = \frac{1}{\text{Var}(\text{Contribution}_i) + \epsilon} $$

Experts with high NeuroScores are cloned (Split); those with low scores are cannibalized (Merge).

## 🧬 Evolution in Silicon: Systematic Hyperparameter Optimization

Manually tuning **48 interacting biological hyperparameters** (time constants, enzyme affinities, energy costs) is intractable for humans. We employ **CMA-ES (Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy)** for systematic, derivative-free optimization.

### The Challenge

Our parameter space includes:
- **10 Calcium Dynamics Parameters** (tau_c, alpha_ca, buffering rates, etc.)
- **12 Vesicle Trafficking Parameters** (RRP refill, priming, endocytosis rates)
- **8 Postsynaptic Plasticity Parameters** (Hebbian gains, CaMKII/PP1, BDNF)
- **6 Structural Plasticity Parameters** (energy costs, split/merge thresholds)
- **12 Rust Kernel Compatibility Parameters** (tau_buf, tau_prime, etc.)

These parameters interact non-linearly across:
- Multiple timescales (ms to seconds)
- Competing objectives (quality vs performance)
- Stochastic dynamics (vesicle release noise)

### Two-Phase CMA-ES Strategy

**Phase 1: Critical Parameters (10D, ~$500)**
Focus on the top-10 most influential parameters identified via sensitivity analysis:
- `tau_rrp_log` - Vesicle refill timescale
- `lambda_loge` - Eligibility trace decay
- `camkii_up_log` - LTP strength
- `pp1_up_log` - LTD strength
- `energy_cost_rel_log` - Metabolic taxation
- (Plus 5 more... see full plan)

**Phase 2: Subgroup Searches (38D staged, ~$2000)**
With Phase 1 winners fixed, optimize subgroups in parallel:
- **Calcium Group** (8 params): Buffering, sensor kinetics
- **Vesicle Group** (9 params): Priming, endocytosis, SNARE
- **Postsynaptic Group** (7 params): Hebbian, BDNF, CaMKII/PP1
- **Structural Group** (8 params): Energy, health, routing
- **Kernel Compat Group** (6 params): Rust-specific parameters

**Objective Function:**
Multi-objective composite balancing:
- **Quality** (70%): Perplexity, NIAH accuracy, calibration (ECE)
- **Performance** (30%): Tokens/sec, memory efficiency

See [PLAN_TO_USE_CMAES_FOR_HYPERPARAMETER_EXPLORATION_AND_OPTIMIZATION_ACROSS_ALL_BIO_INSPIRED_FEATURES.md](PLAN_TO_USE_CMAES_FOR_HYPERPARAMETER_EXPLORATION_AND_OPTIMIZATION_ACROSS_ALL_BIO_INSPIRED_FEATURES.md) for the complete 15,000-word plan including:
- Detailed parameter inventory with biological justification
- Search space design and encoding strategies
- Fast proxy objective with learning-curve extrapolation
- Distributed evaluation harness design
- Budget tracking and go/no-go checkpoints
- Risk mitigation and sensitivity analysis

### Quick Start with CMA-ES

```bash
# Phase 1: Optimize top-10 critical parameters
uv run scripts/tune_bio_params.py --phase=1 --population=20 --generations=50

# Phase 2: Optimize calcium subgroup with Phase 1 winners
uv run scripts/tune_bio_params.py --phase=2 --subgroup=calcium
```

This will:
- ✅ Run distributed evaluation across available GPUs
- ✅ Log covariance evolution and convergence to TensorBoard
- ✅ Save per-generation checkpoints for resume safety
- ✅ Emit best parameters to `best_synaptic_config.json`

- **Rust**: rustfmt, clippy
- **Commits**: Conventional Commits (feat, fix, docs, chore, etc.)
- **Documentation**: Inline docstrings + README updates for public APIs

### Research Contributions

Have an idea for a new bio-inspired mechanism? We'd love to hear it!

1. **Biological Grounding**: Cite neuroscience literature
2. **Mathematical Formulation**: Write equations clearly
3. **Implementation Plan**: Sketch algorithm + complexity analysis
4. **Ablation Plan**: How will you measure impact vs vanilla?

## 🧬 Legacy Nanochat Features
*(Inherited from the base [Nanochat](https://github.com/karpathy/nanochat) repo)*

This repo remains fully compatible with the original "silicon" workflows:
*   **`speedrun.sh`**: Train a standard static GPT-2.
*   **`scripts/chat_web.py`**: Chat UI.
*   To disable biology, just run without `--synapses` flag.
