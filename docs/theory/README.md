# The Leapfrog Theory Program — START HERE (bead `0642.9`)

> _Entry point for the theory program (`label: theory`)._ Kept current as thrusts land.

## The unifying picture

The synaptic transformer is best read as a **stochastic, gauge-covariant, metriplectic neural SDE on a
fiber bundle with separated timescales**. The synapse has a hierarchy of strata, each evolving on its
own timescale:

```
        calcium  ≪  release  ≪  fast_weights  ≪  slow_weights  ≪  structure
```

Each **thrust** applies the *right* piece of esoteric mathematics to *one* stratum, and the
**composition keystone** (`0642.10`) certifies — at runtime, from the measured timescale separation —
that the strata are decoupled enough for the thrusts to compose without interfering.

## The discipline (every thrust obeys it)

1. **Compile** the math into runtime artifacts (a certificate / monitor / kernel).
2. State a **falsifiable hypothesis** vs a *named* baseline, tested with multi-seed stats (`74f`).
3. Carry an explicit **proof-obligation & assumptions ledger**.
4. Ship a **deterministic fallback** to the engineering baseline, so a failed bet never breaks
   training — behind a **default-off toggle** (`hm4.7`).

## Reading order (by EV and dependency)

1. **Thrust A — Metriplectic/GENERIC dynamics** (the stability keystone; do first).
2. **Thrust F — Singular-perturbation / cusp** (certified memory + the timescale-separation backbone).
3. **The composition keystone** (`0642.10`) — the timescale-separation certificate that licenses
   composing everything else.
4. **Thrust E** (thermo UQ), **Thrust B** (ultrametric memory), then **Thrust C** (topological NAS).
5. Planned: **H** (tropical), **D** (gauge), **G** (sheaf).

## The composition keystone (`0642.10`)

Before composing multiple math families, the alien-artifact discipline requires a
**timescale-separation statement**. The keystone measures `ε_k = τ_fast / τ_slow` per coupling
(`separation_gauge.py`) and gates each thrust certificate on it (`composition.py`):

- **Eligibility guard** (`0642.10.2`): a thrust *composes* iff its coupling is separated (`ε_k < eps_max`),
  else its deterministic fallback trips. _Honest finding:_ at the **defaults** the
  `release→fast_weights` coupling is not separated (`ε≈1.63`), so the cusp thrust F falls back there.
- **Pairwise interference harness** (`0642.10.3`): two thrusts may co-activate only if every boundary
  *between* their strata is separated; otherwise the **higher-risk** thrust is auto-disabled and the
  lower-risk keystone keeps running.

## How to use these notes

- Each per-thrust note follows the same skeleton: the dynamical system *as it actually is* → the
  results with derivations → a **proof-obligation & assumptions ledger** (with fail-closed fallbacks)
  → **numerical corroboration** against the live code (in `tests/`).
- The reference modules are pure, dependency-light (`numpy`/`torch`), and default-off; nothing here
  changes the live model unless a toggle is set.
- Falsification beads (`0642.*.3`) carry the headline hypotheses; several await trained-model evals.
