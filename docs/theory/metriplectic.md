# Metriplectic / GENERIC Synaptic Dynamics — Theory Note (bead `0642.1.1`)

_Thrust A — stability & conservation by construction. Author: GoldenRiver · 2026-06-12._

## Purpose & scope

This note casts the synaptic relaxation dynamics in **GENERIC / metriplectic** form — the structure
that makes *energy conservation*, *entropy production*, and a *free-energy Lyapunov function*
hold **by construction** rather than by clamping. It fixes the contract the downstream beads build
against: the structure-preserving (discrete-gradient) integrator `0642.1.2.1`, the Lyapunov /
domain-of-attraction subtask `0642.1.1.5`, the reversible-flow O(1)-memory backprop `0642.1.1.6`, the
free-energy *deliberation* capability `r00r.1`, and the capstone master SDE `0642.11`.

A GENERIC system writes the flow of the state `z` as a **reversible** plus an **irreversible** part,

```
            dz/dt = L(z) · ∇E(z)  +  M(z) · ∇S(z),
```

with `L` skew-symmetric (a Poisson/Hamiltonian bracket — conserves energy) and `M` symmetric
positive-semidefinite (a friction/dissipation operator — produces entropy), subject to the two
**degeneracy conditions**

```
            L · ∇S = 0        (entropy is a Casimir of the reversible bracket),
            M · ∇E = 0        (dissipation does no net work on the energy).
```

These give, with no further assumptions, `dE/dt = 0`, `dS/dt ≥ 0`, and hence the free energy
`F = E − T·S` is a Lyapunov function. We (i) identify `E, S, L, M` and the Casimirs for the live
synaptic state, (ii) **prove** the degeneracy conditions for the chosen parameterization, (iii)
derive the conservation/production/Lyapunov chain and the **bounded-trajectory** certificate, and
(iv) corroborate all of it numerically (`tests/test_metriplectic_theory.py`). The **baseline
comparator** is the shipped `vg9` clamped-Euler step (`vg9.5`/`vg9.7`): dissipative-stable (the
`yw9.7` contraction `cb_spectral_radius < 1`) but *not* structure-preserving — it does not exactly
conserve `E` or the vesicle Casimir at finite step. This note specifies the structure the
discrete-gradient integrator will preserve exactly.

## 0. Where reversibility, dissipation, and conservation live in the synapse

The presynaptic state is `(C, BUF, RRP, RES, DELAY, PR, CL, E_met)` (`build_presyn_state`,
`release_canonical`). Three physically distinct behaviors are already present in the code:

- **Reversible exchange** — the **calcium ↔ buffer** shuttle: `αon` moves free calcium `C` into the
  bound store `BUF`, `αoff` releases it back (`docs/stable_recurrence_theory.md` §2). In the
  conservative limit this is a *lossless exchange* of calcium between two forms — the reversible core.
- **Dissipation** — the **leaky decays** `ρc, ρb < 1` (and the energy/complexin/reserve leaks). They
  relax the state toward rest; `yw9.7` proves the calcium↔buffer map is strictly contractive
  (`ρ(M_cb) < 1`). Dissipation is what *produces entropy*.
- **Conservation (Casimir)** — the **vesicle pool** `N = RRP + RES + Σ DELAY` is conserved
  *structurally* by the paired-transfer depletion/refill (`yw9.2.2`, `_vesicle_step`). It is a
  Casimir: untouched by both brackets.

The metriplectic model below is the minimal closed system that carries all three. We use the reduced
calcium core `z = (C, B, h)`: free calcium `C`, buffered calcium `B` (≡ `BUF` content), and a scalar
**heat / entropy reservoir** `h` that books the energy the leaks dissipate. The vesicle pool enters
as the Casimir `N` (§6). This is the faithful reduction: the calcium↔buffer pair is exactly the only
non-trivially-coupled subsystem (`yw9.7` §1), and the pools are conservation-bounded.

## 1. Energy `E(z)` and entropy `S(z)`  → subtask `0642.1.1.1`

On `z = (C, B, h)`:

```
            E(z) = ½·C² + ½·B² + h           (stored calcium energy + dissipated heat),
            S(z) = h                          (the heat content is the entropy reservoir).
            ∇E = (C, B, 1),    ∇S = (0, 0, 1).
```

`H(C,B) = ½(C² + B²)` is the **mechanical** (stored-calcium) energy; `h ≥ 0` is the heat the leaks
have produced. `E` is **coercive** (`E → ∞` as `‖z‖ → ∞`, with `h ≥ 0`) — the property that turns
energy conservation into boundedness (§5). `T > 0` is a fixed reference temperature (units relating
heat to entropy).

---

## 2. The skew Poisson operator `L` and the Jacobi identity  → subtask `0642.1.1.2`

The reversible part is the lossless calcium↔buffer exchange, a rotation in the `(C, B)` plane that
leaves the heat untouched:

```
                ⎡  0    ω    0 ⎤
        L  =    ⎢ −ω    0    0 ⎥ ,        ω > 0  (exchange rate; the buffer on/off scale).
                ⎣  0    0    0 ⎦
```

`L` is **skew-symmetric** (`Lᵀ = −L`) by construction. The associated Poisson bracket
`{f, g} = ∇fᵀ L ∇g` satisfies the **Jacobi identity** trivially: `L` is *constant* (state-independent),
and a constant skew matrix always defines a valid (linear) Poisson structure — the structure
functions `L_ij` have zero derivatives, so the Jacobi closure `Σ (L_il ∂_l L_jk + cyc.) = 0` holds
identically. (When `ω` is later made state-dependent, `0642.1.1.2` must re-verify Jacobi; for the
constant `L` here it is automatic.)

The reversible flow `L∇E = (ω·B, −ω·C, 0)` conserves the mechanical energy:
`dH/dt|_rev = C·(ωB) + B·(−ωC) = 0`, and conserves the total `E` (it does not touch `h`).

---

## 3. The PSD friction operator `M = Bᵀ B`  → subtask `0642.1.1.3`

The dissipation damps `C` and `B` at rates `γ_C, γ_B ≥ 0` (the calcium/buffer leaks `1−ρc, 1−ρb`)
and **deposits the lost energy into the heat** `h`. The operator is

```
                ⎡  γ_C     0     −γ_C·C        ⎤
        M  =    ⎢   0     γ_B    −γ_B·B        ⎥  =  γ_C·u·uᵀ  +  γ_B·v·vᵀ,
                ⎣ −γ_C·C  −γ_B·B  γ_C·C²+γ_B·B² ⎦
                u = (1, 0, −C)ᵀ,   v = (0, 1, −B)ᵀ.
```

Written as `M = γ_C·uuᵀ + γ_B·vvᵀ` it is manifestly **symmetric** and **positive-semidefinite**
(a non-negative combination of rank-1 projectors — the `M = Bᵀ B` form with
`B = [√γ_C·uᵀ ; √γ_B·vᵀ]`). The dissipative flow is

```
        M∇S = M·(0,0,1)ᵀ = ( −γ_C·C, −γ_B·B, γ_C·C² + γ_B·B² )ᵀ,
```

i.e. `Ċ_diss = −γ_C C`, `Ḃ_diss = −γ_B B`, `ḣ_diss = γ_C C² + γ_B B²`: the leaks damp the calcium and
the **exact** energy they remove, `γ_C C² + γ_B B²`, reappears as heat.

---

## 4. Degeneracy conditions ⟹ conservation & production  → subtask `0642.1.1.4`

**Degeneracy (proved for this parameterization).**

```
        L·∇S = L·(0,0,1)ᵀ = (0,0,0)ᵀ = 0.                                  (D1) ✓
        M·∇E = M·(C,B,1)ᵀ:
            row 1:  γ_C·C + 0 − γ_C·C = 0
            row 2:  0 + γ_B·B − γ_B·B = 0
            row 3:  −γ_C·C·C − γ_B·B·B + (γ_C·C² + γ_B·B²) = 0    ⟹   M·∇E = 0.   (D2) ✓
```

(D1) holds because `S` depends only on `h`, which `L` annihilates; (D2) is the algebraic identity
that the heat row exactly balances the damped mechanical rows. Both are **structural** — true for
*every* state `z` and every `ω, γ_C, γ_B ≥ 0`, not just on average.

**The conservation/production theorem.** With `dz/dt = L∇E + M∇S` and (D1)–(D2):

```
  dE/dt = ∇Eᵀ ż = ∇Eᵀ L ∇E + ∇Eᵀ M ∇S
        = 0                  (skew: xᵀLx = 0)
        + (M∇E)ᵀ ∇S = 0      (M symmetric, then D2)            ⟹   dE/dt = 0.

  dS/dt = ∇Sᵀ ż = ∇Sᵀ L ∇E + ∇Sᵀ M ∇S
        = −(L∇S)ᵀ ∇E = 0     (skew, then D1)
        + ∇Sᵀ M ∇S ≥ 0       (M PSD)                            ⟹   dS/dt ≥ 0.
```

Energy is **exactly conserved**; entropy is **non-decreasing**. For the explicit core,
`dE/dt = (Ċ·C + Ḃ·B + ḣ) = (ωCB − γ_C C² − ωCB − γ_B B²) + (γ_C C² + γ_B B²) = 0` and
`dS/dt = ḣ = γ_C C² + γ_B B² ≥ 0`, confirming the abstract result.

---

## 5. `F = E − T·S` is a Lyapunov function ⟹ bounded trajectories  → subtask `0642.1.1.5`

```
        dF/dt = dE/dt − T·dS/dt = 0 − T·(γ_C C² + γ_B B²) ≤ 0       (T > 0).
```

So `F` is **non-increasing** along every trajectory: a Lyapunov function for the relaxation.

**Bounded trajectories (the certificate).** Energy is conserved, so the trajectory is confined to the
level set `Σ_{E₀} = { z : E(z) = E₀ }`. Because `E` is **coercive** and `h ≥ 0`,

```
        ½(C² + B²) + h = E₀,  h ≥ 0   ⟹   C² + B² ≤ 2E₀  and  0 ≤ h ≤ E₀,
```

so `Σ_{E₀}` is **compact**. A trajectory starting on it stays on it (energy conservation) ⟹ **`(C, B,
h)` is bounded for all time**, with the explicit bounds above. No clamp is needed — the bound is a
consequence of the structure.

**Equilibrium & domain of attraction.** `F` decreases until `dF/dt = 0 ⟺ C = B = 0`; the only
invariant set there is `z* = (0, 0, E₀)` — all mechanical energy converted to heat, the **MaxEnt
state on the energy shell** (`S = h = E₀` is maximal subject to `E = E₀`). By LaSalle's invariance
principle on the compact `Σ_{E₀}`, every trajectory on the shell converges to `z*`. The domain of
attraction is the whole shell `Σ_{E₀}` (each energy shell is invariant and has its own `z*`). `F`
attains its minimum `F(z*) = E₀ − T·E₀ = (1−T)E₀` there.

## 6. Casimirs — vesicle conservation  → consumed by `0642.1.2.1`, `0642.11.1`

The **vesicle pool** `N = RRP + RES + Σ DELAY` is a **Casimir**: it commutes with the reversible
bracket (`L ∂N = 0` — `N` does not appear in the `(C,B,h)` core) and is conserved by the dissipative
pool dynamics structurally (`yw9.2.2`: every depletion is a *paired transfer*, never a sink). A
structure-preserving integrator (`0642.1.2.1`) must keep `N` constant to machine precision, exactly
as `_vesicle_step` already does at `rec_rate = 1`. Casimirs foliate the phase space into invariant
leaves `{N = const}`; the metriplectic flow above lives on a single leaf, so the full guarantee is
"bounded on the energy shell **within** the conserved-vesicle leaf."

---

## 7. Proof-obligation & assumptions ledger  → consumed by `0642.1.2`, `0642.10`

| # | Assumption (how discharged) | Statement | Failure mode | Fallback |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| A1 | **`L` skew + Jacobi** — structural; constant `L` ⟹ Jacobi automatic (§2). | reversible part conserves `E`; `S` is its Casimir. | a *learned* state-dependent `ω` breaks Jacobi or skewness. | project `L → ½(L − Lᵀ)`; re-verify Jacobi on a grid; else clamped Euler. |
| A2 | **`M = BᵀB` PSD + `M∇E = 0`** — structural (§3–§4, D2). | dissipation gives `dS/dt ≥ 0` and `dE/dt = 0`. | a learned `M` loses PSD or degeneracy. | project to the PSD/degenerate cone (`M ← P M P`, `P = I − ∇E∇Eᵀ/‖∇E‖²`); else `vg9` clamped step. |
| A3 | **`E` coercive**, `h ≥ 0` (§1). | the energy shell `Σ_{E₀}` is compact ⟹ bounded trajectories. | a non-coercive learned `E` (unbounded below) lets `z` escape. | add a quadratic floor to `E`; or clamp the offending channel. |
| A4 | **`T > 0`** (fixed reference temperature). | `F = E − TS` is non-increasing (Lyapunov). | `T ≤ 0`. | fix `T > 0`. |
| A5 | **Casimir exactness** — `N` paired-transfer conserved (`yw9.2.2`). | trajectory stays on `{N = const}`. | a non-conservative refill (`rec_rate ≠ 1`, lossy clamp). | route excess back to reserve (already done); discrete-gradient integrator preserves `N`. |

**Verification protocol** (the bead's "symbolic + grid check"): D1–D2 are checked symbolically (§4)
and on a random grid of states; PSD of `M` and skewness of `L` are checked on the grid; conservation
/ production / Lyapunov / boundedness are checked by integrating the flow. The structural fallbacks
(projections, clamped Euler) are what the runtime takes when a *learned* `L/M/E` violates A1–A3 — the
same fail-closed discipline as `0642.2.1` (the cusp note).

---

## 8. Numerical corroboration

`tests/test_metriplectic_theory.py` checks the construction directly (no hand-waving):

- **Degeneracy** `‖L∇S‖ = 0` and `‖M∇E‖ = 0` at a grid of random states (D1–D2).
- **Structure** `L + Lᵀ = 0` (skew) and `eig(M) ≥ 0` (PSD) on the grid.
- **Conservation & production** — integrating `ż = L∇E + M∇S` (small-step RK4): `E` drift is
  `O(Δt⁴)` and `→ 0` with the step (the *continuous* flow conserves `E`), `S` is monotone
  non-decreasing, and `F` is non-increasing.
- **Boundedness & convergence** — the trajectory stays inside the shell bound `C² + B² ≤ 2E₀` and
  converges to `z* = (0,0,E₀)`.
- **Baseline contrast** — forward Euler (the `vg9`-style step) drifts `E` markedly more than RK4 at
  the same step, and neither conserves `E` *exactly* — motivating the **discrete-gradient**
  integrator of `0642.1.2.1`, which conserves `E` and `N` to machine precision by construction.

These confirm the *exact* algebraic facts (degeneracy, PSD, skew) and the *qualitative* dynamical
facts (conservation in the continuous limit, monotone `S`, Lyapunov `F`, boundedness) that the
structure-preserving integrator will then realize at finite step.

---

## 9. Relationship to the `vg9` baseline & the reversible-flow backprop  → subtask `0642.1.1.6`

The shipped dynamics are the **`vg9` clamped-Euler** step: stable (the `yw9.7` contraction) and
conservation-bounded for the pools (`yw9.2.2`), but it enforces stability by **clamping** and does
not exactly conserve `E` or respect the metriplectic split. This note upgrades "stable because we
clamp" to "stable **by construction**": `E` coercive + conserved ⟹ bounded; `M` PSD + degenerate ⟹
entropy production; `F` Lyapunov ⟹ relaxation to the MaxEnt equilibrium.

**Reversible-flow ⟹ O(1)-memory backprop** (`0642.1.1.6`, sketch). The reversible sub-flow `ż = L∇E`
is *volume-preserving and time-reversible* (a constant-`L` Hamiltonian flow): its inverse is the flow
under `−L`. So activations along the reversible part need **not** be stored for backprop — they can be
**recomputed by integrating backward**, giving O(1) activation memory in depth (the synaptic analog of
reversible residual nets). The dissipative part is not reversible, so it is checkpointed; the split is
exactly the L/M decomposition above. The full derivation is `0642.1.1.6`.
