## TL;DR

- There is **no `torch.nn.parallel.DistributedDataParallel` wrapper.** Gradient
  synchronization happens **inside the distributed optimizers** (`DistAdamW`, `DistMuon`),
  ZeRO-2 style: gradients are averaged across ranks and optimizer state is sharded.
- Each rank reads a **different data shard** (the dataloader strides row-groups by rank), so
  the effective batch is `device_batch_size × seq_len × world_size × grad_accum`.
- **Per-rank/per-batch synaptic state** (calcium, RRP, energy, eligibility traces) is **not**
  all-reduced — by design. Trained `Parameter`s (slow + fast weights, kinetics) **are** kept
  consistent across ranks (via the optimizer's all-gather and, for structural events, an
  explicit rank-0 broadcast).
- The optimizers are now correct for **every** parameter shape, including the synaptic
  model's 0-D scalar kinetics and odd-length vectors (previously a hard crash under DDP).

## 1. Why no DDP wrapper?

The model trains a 2-D matrix subset with **Muon** (Newton–Schulz orthogonalized SGD) and the
rest (embeddings, `lm_head`, 1-D/0-D params) with **AdamW**. Muon's update is not a simple
elementwise function of the gradient, so the standard "all-reduce grads then step locally"
DDP contract is folded directly into the optimizer instead:

| Optimizer | File | Cross-rank sync | State |
|-----------|------|-----------------|-------|
| `DistAdamW` | `bio_inspired_nanochat/adamw.py` | `reduce_scatter`(AVG) grads → update shard → `all_gather` param | sharded (ZeRO-2) |
| `DistMuon`  | `bio_inspired_nanochat/muon.py`  | `reduce_scatter`(AVG) grads → owner rank orthogonalizes → `all_gather` param | per-owner momentum |

`setup_optimizers` (`gpt.py` and `gpt_synaptic.py`) selects the `Dist*` variants when
`get_dist_info()` reports `ddp=True`, else the plain single-process `AdamW`/`Muon`. The
training loop (`scripts/base_train.py`) just calls `opt.step()` — the sync is invisible to it.

**Consequence:** the loop's `loss.backward()` produces **per-rank** gradients; they are only
averaged when `opt.step()` runs. So gradient accumulation across `grad_accum_steps` is
per-rank-local (correct — each rank accumulates its own micro-batches, then the optimizer
averages the accumulated grads once at step time).

## 2. The shardable / replicated split (the hardening fix)

`DistAdamW` shards each parameter along dim 0, which requires `param.shape[0] % world_size == 0`.
The synaptic model violates this for **small learnable Parameters**:

- **0-D scalars** — `learnable_kinetics=True` (bead `yw9.3`, scale-hardened in `hwxb.4.1`) adds
  per-layer `theta_rho_c`, `theta_alpha_ca`, … scalars. A 0-D tensor has no `shape[0]`, so the
  old code raised `IndexError` on `grad.shape[0]` the moment you enabled it under DDP.
- **Odd-length 1-D vectors** — would make `reduce_scatter_tensor` raise a size-mismatch.

`DistAdamW` now classifies each param:

- **shardable** (`ndim ≥ 1` and `shape[0] % world_size == 0`): ZeRO-2 path — `reduce_scatter`
  the grad, update this rank's slice, `all_gather` the param back.
- **replicated** (0-D, or `shape[0]` not divisible): `all_reduce(AVG)` the grad and apply the
  **full** AdamW update on **every** rank. No scatter/gather; all ranks stay bit-identical
  because they start identical (same init seed) and apply the same update to the same averaged
  grad.

The per-element AdamW math is a single shared helper (`_adamw_update_`), so the two paths are
provably equivalent. `DistMuon` already tolerates arbitrary param counts (it block-cyclically
assigns an owner rank per param and pads short groups with a zero buffer) and requires all
params be 2-D, so it needs no analogous change.

## 3. What is / isn't synchronized

| State | Synced across ranks? | Mechanism |
|-------|----------------------|-----------|
| Model `Parameter` gradients | **Yes** (averaged) | `DistAdamW` / `DistMuon` |
| Model `Parameter` values | **Yes** (kept identical) | identical init seed + optimizer all-gather/replicated update |
| Presyn per-key state (calcium, RRP, energy, buffer, priming) | **No** (per-rank, per-batch) | rebuilt each forward; never registered for reduction |
| Hebbian eligibility traces (`u_buf`, `v_buf`) | **No** (per-rank) | per-sequence buffers, reset at boundaries |
| Fast weights `w_fast` (a trained `Parameter`) | **Yes** | flows through the optimizer like any param |
| MoE metabolism EMAs (energy/fatigue) | drift per-rank between events; **re-synced** on structural events | `synaptic_splitmerge.py` `_broadcast_module_params` (rank-0 → broadcast) when `ddp_broadcast=True` |
| Split/merge decisions | **rank-0 decides**, then broadcasts new weights | `synaptic_splitmerge.py` guards `dist.get_rank()==0` + `dist.barrier()` |

The per-rank presyn/eligibility state is **correct to keep per-rank**: it is a function of each
rank's own data batch, analogous to per-rank activations. Averaging it would be meaningless. The
only thing that must stay globally consistent is the set of trained `Parameter`s and the
discrete structural topology — both handled above.

## 4. Numerics under bf16

Training uses `torch.amp.autocast(dtype=bfloat16)` on CUDA. The synaptic kinetics assume a
reasonable numeric range (calcium/RRP are O(1), Hill terms are bounded). bf16 has ~3 decimal
digits of mantissa, which is fine for the gated/bounded dynamics but means: keep the
`logit_softcap` on for the synaptic head (it bounds the `log(ε+release)` bias injected into
attention logits), and watch `spectral_radius` telemetry (bead `yw9.7`) — a value ≥ 1 signals a
kinetics instability that bf16 will amplify. Muon's Newton–Schulz already runs in bf16 by design.

## 5. NCCL for PCIe (no NVLink)

Two 4090s on a desktop talk over PCIe, not NVLink, so all-reduce bandwidth is the bottleneck.
Recommended environment for the launch:

```bash
export NCCL_P2P_LEVEL=PXB        # allow P2P over PCIe switches/bridges where available
export NCCL_P2P_DISABLE=0        # keep P2P on; set =1 only if you see P2P hangs on your board
export NCCL_DEBUG=WARN           # surface NCCL issues without spamming
export OMP_NUM_THREADS=8         # avoid CPU oversubscription with 2 ranks
export CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0,1
```

If you hit P2P instability on a particular motherboard, fall back to `NCCL_P2P_DISABLE=1`
(slower, but staging through host memory is robust). The model is intentionally small (`D1`:
~133M params untied today, ~91M once the Phase-0 embedding tying lands — `hwxb.2.9`), so the
per-step bf16 gradient all-reduce volume (~266 MB untied / ~182 MB tied) overlaps with backward
and PCIe stays out of the critical path.

## 6. Launch recipe

Single GPU (smoke / debug):

```bash
.venv/bin/python -m scripts.base_train --depth=8 --max_seq_len=1024 \
  --device_batch_size=16 --total_batch_size=131072 --num_iterations=50
```

Dual 4090 (the real path) — `torchrun` sets `RANK`/`LOCAL_RANK`/`WORLD_SIZE`, which
`common.get_dist_info()` reads:

```bash
export NCCL_P2P_LEVEL=PXB OMP_NUM_THREADS=8
.venv/bin/torchrun --standalone --nproc_per_node=2 -m scripts.base_train \
  --depth=10 --max_seq_len=1024 \
  --device_batch_size=16 --total_batch_size=262144   # = 16*1024*2*8 grad-accum
```

`total_batch_size` must be divisible by `device_batch_size × seq_len × world_size`
(`base_train.py` asserts this and derives `grad_accum_steps`).

## 7. Correctness guarantees & tests

**CPU-runnable (CI, no GPU)** — `tests/test_scaleup_ddp.py` spawns a real 2-process **gloo**
group and proves:

- `DistAdamW(world_size=2)` on split gradients == single-process AdamW on the averaged gradient,
  **including a 0-D scalar and an odd-length vector** (the replicated path), to fp32 precision.
- `DistMuon(world_size=2)` == single-process `Muon` on averaged gradients (bf16 NS tolerance).

These validate the parts that are hardware-independent: gradient averaging, optimizer-state
sharding + re-replication, and the non-shardable fallback. (To make them run on CPU, both
optimizers now `.wait()` on the collective `Work` handle instead of `.get_future()`, which gloo
does not implement; NCCL behavior is unchanged.)

**GPU-gated (manual, requires the 2×4090 box)** — the remaining acceptance from the bead: a
2-GPU run (vanilla **and** synaptic) whose loss trajectory matches a single-GPU run at matched
effective batch, with no NCCL hangs and finite loss. Run the launch recipe above on the
hardware and diff the `train/loss` curves; they should agree within bf16 tolerance. This is the
one piece that cannot be exercised without the GPUs and is tracked as the residual manual check.
